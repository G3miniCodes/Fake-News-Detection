# Fake-News-Detection
Description:
Our project 🤖 combines Logistic Regression and Natural Language Processing (NLTK) to tackle misinformation. 🧠 Using a labeled dataset, the model learns patterns from news articles' linguistic features. NLTK aids in preprocessing and feature extraction, enhancing the model's ability to classify articles as genuine or fake. The goal is to provide users with a reliable tool to identify and filter deceptive news in today's information-rich landscape. 🌐🔍
